- why 'userList' in NowPlaying not updating
  - maybe on joinRoom, have it emit user array from server
  - when should 'userList' be retrieved? onEffect where?

- name change doesnt update userList name

- rearrange chat
- userList not updating, userList in Chat updating
- userListLeave socket



- room doesnt have to be in every file

- dispatch to use useReducer

- chat area
- rooms

- search bar for youtube
- youtube api
- video player


router
- show list of user profiles
- user profiles contains info ex. name, twitter handle, etc


DONE - chat bottom when changing name
DONE - Body and Chat both call socket 'user', call from Room and pass as prop
DONE - Create user name in server?
  - This would connect id to name so on 'disconnect' name can be emitted to client since no way to emit name from client
